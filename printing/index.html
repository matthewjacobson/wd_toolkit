If you currently own one of the 600 Watercolor Dreams tokens and can prove wallet ownership with a cryptographic signature you are eligible to purchase a 1/1 limited edition, artist signed, archival-quality print, corresponding to the token # that you own.

Please note: these prints are truly one-of-one. If a print has already been made for a certain token it will no longer be eligable. You can find a list of mints that have already been printed here.

Prints are 18x18 in (including a 1 in margin). The price per print is $200 (PayPal, ETH), which also covers packaging and shipping (unframed, tube-rolled). To purchase, email numbersinmotion@gmail.com with the following details:

- Token #s that you can prove ownership of, and wish to have printed
- Ethereum wallet address
- Shipping address
- Any custom requests (print size, scaling, frame number, etc.)
